This was a short programming test for joining <a href="https://badmedicine.itch.io">Bad Medicine Games</a>. <!--more-->The assignment was to implement a drag-to-launch flick mechanism, similar to Angry Birds. In addition, I was supposed to bring my own creative flair to the test. I decided to change the perspective into a pinball style drag-to-launch mechanism, with multiple balls being lanuched simultaneously and bumpers to add to the chaos. 

Total development time was approximately 2 hours.
