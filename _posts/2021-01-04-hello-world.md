Every time I try to type "Hello World" I end up typing "Hellow World" instead. I don't know what that says about me. It never feels like an auspicious start to a new project, though. 

Anyway, here goes nothing. If you're reading this, you're probably related to me. Thanks for being so supportive of my strange journey through life.

I'm planning on using this blog to analyze games I'm playing and discuss my experiences developing games. I may write tutorials based on skills that I learn along the way. Teaching is a passion of mine, after all.
