Hi! I'm Ari. 

I used to work in education doing science curriculum development. Now I'm making video games.

My favorite feeling in the world is discovering how to do better next time. I like to do things that give me that feeling:
<ul>
    <li>Playing games (both board games and video games)</li>
    <li>Cooking, baking, and mixing cocktails</li>
    <li>Blowing glass</li>
    <li>Rock climbing</li>
</ul>

I also like math, physics, hiking, and skiing.
