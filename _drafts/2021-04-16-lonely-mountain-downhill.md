This is the first in what I hope will be a series of blog posts where I write about a game that I'm currently playing.

Recently I've been playing a lot of **Lonely Mountain: Downhill**. It is a nice mountain biking game. I think it suffers from some pretty critical design problems, but I have found myself coming back to it over and over when I want to play a low-stakes game to relax. 

# Aesthetics  
It has really clean, low-poly art. It has beautiful sound design. The game has no music--the only sounds are ambient nature sounds and the sounds of biking. Tires scraping on dirt, thumps when you drop onto a rock, sometimes the rider grunts. They do a great job of making an immersive nature experience.

One of the most notable things about the game is the camera perspective. Instead of having a first person or over-the-shoulder third person camera that I'd expect a biking game to have, the camera is angled almost like it is a drone filming the biker. It has a fixed, overhead perspective out from the mountain, pointing down at around 45 degrees. It gives sweeping views of the landscape, but I think the perspective leads to quite a few issues in the design.

# Controls
My first issue with the game's design is the way you steer the bike. The game offers two different steering options. Both use the left stick of a gamepad. 

In the first option (which I prefer), left/right on the stick map to the biker steering to their left/right. This is somewhat intuitive, because when riding a real bike you can only steer left or right. It also feels great when the character is riding away from the camera. You press the stick left and the character turns left. You press the stick right and the character turns right. However, when the character is riding toward the camera, the situation is reversed. You press the stick left and the character turns toward the right side of the screen, even though they're turning the handlebars to their left. It is possible to get used to the control scheme, but even after hours of playing I sometimes mistake left and right and crash because I turned the wrong way.

In the second option, the direction that you press the stick corresponds directly to the direction that the biker moves on screen. If you press the stick left, the biker turns toward the left side of the screen. If you press the stick up, the biker turns toward the top of the screen. This seems like it should be more intuitive, but in practice it clashes strongly with my intiution about how biking works. I expect that if I hold the control stick in one position, the biker will hold their handlebars in one position and either continue turning or continue going straight. However, in this control scheme the biker starts turning when you move the control stick, but straightens out once they have aligned themselves with the direction you are pressing. I find it very counter-intutive and difficult to predict.
